NAME
    runnerutils - utilities for runners under python

DESCRIPTION
    A toolkit to abstract away most of the common drudgery associated with
    creating scripts or runners. The mainstay is the class RunnerBase which
    allows you to inherit this functionality into your own runner class.

PYRUN
    This script allows you to instantiate and run a runner class that is
    installed in a package. Just specify the fully qualified path on the
    command line:
        pyrun [pyrun options] package_name.MyRunnerClass [MyRunnerClass options]
